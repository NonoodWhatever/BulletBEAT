Darker area = Passable
Lighter area = Impassable

Enemy and Player should be light.
Based on player and enemy sprite, all props should not be pixelated.

For Dev.
Green Dot = Player Spawn point.
Red area = Blocker.

You may want to check on the NOTEFORMAPPLAN.txt for an updated one.

The TestMap is rushed and uses paint to draw a map.
The Future maps should use Photoshop for the sake of an improved map.

Prop may be created and placed later in the map.
